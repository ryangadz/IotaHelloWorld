# IotaHelloWorld
Learning how to use Iota tangle with a simple open source project. 

First make sure you understand the basic concepts of Iota, generating a seed, and a full node.
You don't need to have your own full node you can use one of the listed at https://iotanode.host/

Super noob directions (skip if you already have visual studio, node.js,  github etc:
1. download and install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/
2. download Visual Studio Community 2017 https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
3. install Visual Studio but make sure you click the option for javascript
4. add the github extension for Visual Studio

5. add iota library to node.js by the command prompt (windows + cmd) and type:
   npm install --save iota.lib.js iotap 
6. connect to your github account in Visual Studio
7. click the green button above to clone this repo in Visual Studio

so far this will connect to an iota full node of your choice and give details about that node.
